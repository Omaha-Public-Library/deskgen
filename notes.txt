======== to do ========

Station gen - want to revisit this later and try less agressive sorting with more neutral 0 outcomes, to prevent last sorts from having outsized impact, OR switch to using a value sorting system where lots of different factors contribute to a single sorting value

should settings be saved in deskschedule? or in history? or properties service?

split shifts merging (reuse function for repeat position merging)

openHours - implement half-hour times

megaphone user shown when only events are all day - check and hide user

auto hide settings+template

nuetral positionpriority sorting option - when none specified, sort staff by name then offset by date for even rotation?

instead of counting hours to evenly assign stations to all eligible staff, why not just prioritize eligible staff who haven't been on this shift at all? less counting, simpler, still get people doing varied things throughout day, might be enough to roughly even out distribution

right now, if someone isn't on todays schedule, but is assigned to location, and have an event on gcal, AND showing all staff... event will display on event timeline, not the staff's timeline

maybe have prepass consider available and meal as equal, so that it doesn't avoid half hour time off fragments next to meal

pictimeline won't defrag if no one is available (sundays,half hour where all staff are on lunch, DT 11.16)

gcal event hover isn't working on non-scheduled user events in bottom cell (but timeline is?) GEN 11.13.25

delete archived sheets at certain age?

set up dev wiw account for authentication and api requests

warning when not subscribed to gcal

wiw location notes - dt parking

handle overlapping events not assigned to specific staff - stagger across multiple rows

add explanation about multiple duty lists on settings page
add reverse button to station priority

show time range option for duty lists
load settings fails if settings cell is blank, should only affect first run but maybe add catch
add error alerts when position can't be found
show default stations on setting menu
dynamic assignment of duty cells depending on number of lists
Duty position/PIC requirements
copy station doesn't correctly copy limit type

======== aaron meeting notes ========
seperate data structure from logic
consider whether your data format matches the storage medium
check if appscript ui has good sorting/query stuff  you're not making use of
state seperate from logic in desksched - move generation functions elsewhere
even station assignment stuff should be unit testable - needs definite inputs and outputs
consider framework for ui settings - yup for form validation, grid something for station input

======== wiw bugs? ========
there are tags on users that don't exist in https://worktags.api.wheniwork-production.com/tags... could they have been assigned, then the tag deleted? see Julie's tag 4fec1268-8989-44a1-87d3-830de8d21462
maybe I should just never assume that any data referenced in old shifts matches current data in WIW... users, tags, positions, etc


======== bethany matt meeting ========
one calender includes
events
programs being delivered in the branch
meetings
volunteers

ft pic of any position on opening, closing

doc for all of scheduling - wiw deskgen gcal

======== stacy schedule sharing questions ========
we need to test if a manager can assign their staff to an openshift on another schedule that they don't have permission to edit
if not, assigning staff could be tricky when there's lots of sharing going on
we need to think more about - when staff are being shared, what's the procedure? receiving schedule creates open schedule, then managers assign staff?
is there a better way to have managers 
we're not using locations at all right now...

======== candidate list sorting algorithm notes ========
candidate list based
problem now is that, while going through stations in priority order for a given half hour, we don't conisder later priority stations with limited assignment options
eg- only one PIC available, and they're required for station third in priority list, but they get assigned to first station, and then no one is available  for #3
this also affects fragmentation - staffA was previously on stationB for half hour, but in next half hour they're assigned to stationA before they can be prioritized for stationB

what if - before assigning, create a candidate list for each position (or two? preferred, then possible?) of staff who are eligible for a station. Then, instead of going through stations in priority order, sort them by number of preferred candidates available, so the trickier stations are handled first. As stations are assigned, remove staff from other candidate lists.

Could this handle better distribution of time off desk too?
====================================================

================ Amy notes ================
abms approve shift changes? time off requests?
position eligibility multiple positions, eligible based on tags?
wheniwork feature request, supervisor see other schedules
supervisors can edit anyone's availabilty?
storytime rotation based on storytime training in WIW?
programming/storytime tags for eligibility, standardized, multiple types of storytime!

wiw support hour count
communico - amy would like to assign extra person to tech desk only when equipment reservation is made in communico
===========================================

questions for managers -
tasks vs stations - should tasks like shelving/delivery be stations or tasks? should it just depend on branch?
closures - do people want this to be in WIW, gcal, both, neither?

WIW permissions
===========================================
Supervisors can't add users to schedule - Manager will need to manage all staff transitions, which could take multiple steps weeks apart



1/22 meeting
day of reassignment saving day so far, minimizing shuffling
do space staff - may want to prioritize staff in training to be at do space more often
dospace tag may be necessary
1 lead pic per floor except ASRS
follow up with travis about adding new staff to WIW
when multiple staff are over duration limit, not prioritizing who to take off first
alwaysShowAllStaff not working?

next eliz reccomends:
central
benson
elkhorn
florence
saddlerook
south omaha
willa cather
washington - new manager

one sheet for docs
abms might help managers, get docs for both

system awareness

================ 1/28 Autumn at Millard ================
get rid of zeros on staff shift times
last name initials
gcal description display over events

station option to treat as duty? maybe call "subtask" of X station, don't add to grid, add to "X Duties" list
break up long tasks between multiple staff?







1 abm assigned roving each floor
stacy suggests: mobile station acts as roving, will always have phone and can move floors?
3 4hr shifts where ABM is lead PIC for building - but they could not be on help desk on 1st and 2nd floor
mobile stations can be reassigned, but not service desksched
2 people on service desks, one stay at desk one roving, they trade off on their own
Matt - assign 4hr shift to ABM, and if we leave 3 on second and not 4, that's okay

3-4-2, first second third

3 people staffed for ASRS, can go down to 1 - pull them for covereage on other floors, which is priority

GEN - pull when 0 staff available - if we have 1 gen staff, no coverage needed
2nd floor - 3 minimum, mobile and 2 service, and pull staff if less than that
1st floor - same as sencond

12 minimum plus abms at all times

no aides, everyone should be able to do all duties - assign in rotation to all staff

clerks/aides duties
aides can't do money

lead PICS for all floors AND abm building pic - building PIC can be floor pic but only if they're not on service desk (workstation)
all floor roving when assigned ABM lead pic - (no other roving station, mobile workstations will do some roving)
associates only get 2 off desks or so - check document / numbers that stacy sent

actually, no designated ASRS team, all associates rotate between assignment to 1 2 3 ASRS?

"dream list next geneation thing" - reporting tool - how many hours on desk, how many off
do space handled by two on 2nd service desk, no need to designate further

we want to be able to look at schedules by april 13th


2nd meeting autumn!
WIW request monthly repeats
must report and delete
figure out manager shift splitting
autumn thinks its ok to open things up and trust ABMs
what tag groups should we use to determing for eligibility (spec+, clerk+, etc)? crash manager meeting next week?

desk staff (no aides), aides, PIC as duty eligibility bools

stuff for standards group

pull list - check why half hour long stations are preassigned in prepass - thurs 2.5 when pink is set 1.5 in morning
how far off is each staff from goal percentage of time off desk?

sort aide list by start time

WIW scheduler staff order can be customized
