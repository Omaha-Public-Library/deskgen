======== to do ========
don't display before/after times (like late night events that don't need to be on sched)
downside - can't see scheduled staff in GCAL when making events... unless, could you use "meet with" to see staff? would they have to import wiw cal?
more testing for parseDate (12pm noon)

Station gen - want to revisit this later and try less agressive sorting with more neutral 0 outcomes, to prevent last sorts from having outsized impact, OR switch to using a value sorting system where lots of different factors contribute to a single sorting value

should settings be saved in deskschedule? or in history? or properties service?

warning about events scheduled outside shifts?

split shifts merging (reuse function for repeat position merging)

openHours - implement half-hour times

replace WIW annotation closures with gcal for all branch announcements? maybe...but is it useful for managers to have closures in WIW?

megaphone user shown when only events are all day - check and hide user

auto hide settings+template

nuetral positionpriority sorting option - when none specified, sort staff by name then offset by date for even rotation?

instead of counting hours to evenly assign stations to all eligible staff, why not just prioritize eligible staff who haven't been on this shift at all? less counting, simpler, still get people doing varied things throughout day, might be enough to roughly even out distribution

right now, if someone isn't on todays schedule, but is assigned to location, and have an event on gcal, AND showing all staff... event will display on event timeline, not the staff's timeline

maybe have prepass consider available and meal as equal, so that it doesn't avoid half hour time off fragments next to meal

pictimeline won't defrag if no one is available (sundays,half hour where all staff are on lunch, DT 11.16)

gcal event hover isn't working on non-scheduled user events in bottom cell (but timeline is?) GEN 11.13.25

when events are scheduled before open, timeline breaks - Swanson 12/8

delete archived sheets at certain age?

set up dev wiw account for authentication and api requests

======== aaron meeting notes ========
seperate data structure from logic
consider whether your data format matches the storage medium
check if appscript ui has good sorting/query stuff  you're not making use of
state seperate from logic in desksched - move generation functions elsewhere
even station assignment stuff should be unit testable - needs definite inputs and outputs
consider framework for ui settings - yup for form validation, grid something for station input

======== wiw bugs? ========
there are tags on users that don't exist in https://worktags.api.wheniwork-production.com/tags... could they have been assigned, then the tag deleted? see Julie's tag 4fec1268-8989-44a1-87d3-830de8d21462
maybe I should just never assume that any data referenced in old shifts matches current data in WIW... users, tags, positions, etc

======== stacy schedule sharing questions ========
we need to test if a manager can assign their staff to an openshift on another schedule that they don't have permission to edit
if not, assigning staff could be tricky when there's lots of sharing going on
we need to think more about - when staff are being shared, what's the procedure? receiving schedule creates open schedule, then managers assign staff?
is there a better way to have managers 
we're not using locations at all right now...

======== candidate list sorting algorithm notes ========
candidate list based
problem now is that, while going through stations in priority order for a given half hour, we don't conisder later priority stations with limited assignment options
eg- only one PIC available, and they're required for station third in priority list, but they get assigned to first station, and then no one is available  for #3
this also affects fragmentation - staffA was previously on stationB for half hour, but in next half hour they're assigned to stationA before they can be prioritized for stationB

what if - before assigning, create a candidate list for each position (or two? preferred, then possible?) of staff who are eligible for a station. Then, instead of going through stations in priority order, sort them by number of preferred candidates available, so the trickier stations are handled first. As stations are assigned, remove staff from other candidate lists.

Could this handle better distribution of time off desk too?
