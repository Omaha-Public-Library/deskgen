# Deskgen, the OPL desk schedule generator
Deskgen is an app that automatically builds desk schedules using information from WhenIWork and your branch Google Calendar, customized using manager settings. It runs right from your branch desk schedule spreadsheet, and produces schedules in the form of sheets that are familiar and easy to edit. Our goal is to make generating schedules faster, easier, and more standardized across the system, while making sure managers can still customize their schedules to fit their specific branches and teams.

Deskgen is being rolled out one branch at a time, and will hopefully be available to all branches by the time Central opens.

# Quick Start
## Making a schedule
When a branch gets started with Deskgen, they'll be provided with a new Google Sheet that will replace their old desk schedule.

To make a schedule, look for the "Generator" dropdown menu at the top right of the page. In that menu you'll have the option to remake the schedule that you have open, or make a new schedule for the following day. Click one of these options, and wait a few seconds for the app to run.

Once your new schedule is generated, check it over to make sure everything looks good. The new schedule will be a normal sheet that you can edit like your old one, but try to keep edits to a minimum - one of the big advantages of this app is that you can quickly regenerate schedules the day of to reflect last minute staff changes, new meetings, etc, and if you regenerate a schedule it won't include the edits you made before.

Instead, a better way to change the schedule is through the settings that control how it generates. For example, if you notice staff are being assigned to be on the front desk for longer than you'd like, don't manually reassign them - just change the relevant setting and regenerate the schedule. See the [Settings section](#Settings) for more info.

Settings are found in the "SETTINGS" sheet of your desk schedule spreadsheet (if you don't see it, check the hidden sheets in the bottom left ≡ icon). In this sheet 

It will include a "SETTINGS" sheet that determines how your schedule is made, which is pre-set to match your existing schedule as closely as possible.

Settings also control where important information comes from, like which WIW schedule  or Google Calendar to use.
